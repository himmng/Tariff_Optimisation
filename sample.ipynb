    "\n",
    "Procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "For smart-meter customers, compute normalized daily load shapes (e.g., mean weekday shape, mean weekend shape). Normalise by daily mean or peak to focus on shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features: 24-hour vector, day-of-week differences, seasonal average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm: K-Means (k=8–12) or HDBSCAN (if variable cluster sizes). Use DTW distance if alignment matters (but slower).\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation: silhouette score + visual inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign cluster_id to each smart-meter customer.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Goal: predict hourly kWh for each customer or cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary: LightGBM (fast, explainable, supports quantile via custom objectives or use LightGBM quantile plugin).\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary: LSTM/Transformer for customers with long history and complex temporal dependencies (optional, for high-value customers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic: Quantile regression or Ensemble (bootstrap) to get 5/50/95 quantiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training details (LightGBM):\n",
    "\n",
    "Features: engineered features above + customer_id as categorical (only if serving smart-meter customers); prefer cluster_id.\n",

    "Hyperparameters (starting point):\n",

    "\n",
    "feature_fraction = 0.8, bagging_fraction = 0.8, bagging_freq = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation: rolling time split (train on first 80% time, validate on next 10%, test on last 10%). Use group CV to avoid leakage (group by customer if per-customer models).\n",

    "Goal: estimate short-run price elasticity by cluster and time-of-day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "If historical price variation exists: use log-log regression Δlog(Q) = ε * Δlog(P) + controls. Controls: temp, hour dummies, weekend, holiday, lag consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "If weak price variation: design small randomized price pilots (preferred) or use instrumental variable (IV) approach (use exogenous cost shocks as instrument).\n",
    "\n",
    "Model: panel regression with customer fixed effects or difference-in-difference when evaluating pilot events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs: elasticity matrix ε[cluster, time_of_day] with confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5 — Imputation pipeline for old-meter customers\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure (deterministic + probabilistic):\n",
    "\n",
    "Map each old-meter customer to a cluster using available attributes (postcode → feeder → cluster distribution). Use feeder-level cluster proportions as priors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each customer, use the cluster-level forecasting model to generate hourly shape for the billing period given weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scale the hourly vector so sum equals recorded monthly/quarterly kWh. If only feeder-aggregates available, scale at feeder-level to ensure reconciliation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For uncertainty, generate N samples by:\n",
    "\n",
    "sampling quantiles from predictive distribution; or\n",
    "\n",
    "sampling model with bootstrap; or\n",
    "\n",
    "sampling cluster assignment if ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation: backtest by selecting a hold-out set of smart-meter customers, strip hourly data leaving only monthly totals, run imputation, then compare imputed hourly to true hourly.\n",

    "Step 7 — Tariff optimiser (prescriptive)\n",
